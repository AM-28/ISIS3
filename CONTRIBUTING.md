Once you have read that please [submit](https://isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov/fixit/projects/isis/issues/new) a Redmine issue.

### Working on an existing issue or enhancement

2. Propose a solution on the redmine issue. 
3. Work with an ISIS3 developer, the issue reporter, and any other interested parties to get feedback on your solution. This may be an iterative process.
4. Add an [impact statement](https://isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov/fixit/projects/isis/wiki/Impact_Statement) to the redmine issue. If you don't have the permission to do this, please make a note on the issue with the impact statement.
